# spring-boilerplate
It's just a basic side project for a boilerplate application.

For build you need Java 21 and Docker.
First go to root of the project and run this command : ``` docker-compose up ```

Then you can build the spring boot application.

After a successful build you can visit this link to see the api's  : [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/)

I will add some features later.
